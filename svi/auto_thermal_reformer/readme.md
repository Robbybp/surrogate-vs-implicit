In this folder we will show three different formulations for the optimization problem of an ATR flowsheet:

1. Full Space Formulation (Using the GibbsReactor class from IDAES)
2. ALAMO Surrogate Formulation (Replacing the GibbsReactor class with ALAMO surrogates)
3. Implicit Function Formulation (Replacing the GibbsReactor class with an Implicit Function)
